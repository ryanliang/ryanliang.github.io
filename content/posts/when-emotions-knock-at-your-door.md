Today's church workshop was about how to deal with emotions.  It can be summarized as follow:

## S.A.R
### Study
- What is emotion?
-- It's an output message based on the input you expreience.
- What is its nature?
- What is its function?
### Awareness
- Be aware of the external factors, such as environment, cultures and (childhood) backgrounds.
- Be aware of the internal factors, such as your personality, your relationship, your faith.
### Reflection
- Why this situation happens often?
- What are the usual responses?
- What consquence is led to by my responses?
- What is the unsatisfied need?

## A.T.M
### Acknowledge
- What emotions I am experiencing?  How do I label the emotions?
### Time-out
- Take deep breath, slow it down and buy you some reaction time.
- What is my specific need?
- What is my narrative?  What do I tell myself what's going on now?
- (Optional) what is the counterparty's need?
### Manage Response
- Is my narrative reasonable? Does it make sense?
- Is my need reasonable?
- Based on this reflection, what is the most optimal response to my emotion?

Hope you can deal with your emotions more effectively!
